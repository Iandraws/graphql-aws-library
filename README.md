# graphql-aws-library
A simple GraphQL API built with TypeScript, Apollo Server, and AWS SDK v3. It uses DynamoDB Local (via Docker) as a NoSQL database and provides full CRUD operations for managing books. This project demonstrates API design, GraphQL schema &amp; resolver implementation, and local cloud development without AWS costs.
